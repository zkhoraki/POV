    <h1>Period and the Menstrual Cycle</h1>
    <br>
  <div class="topic">
    <p class="middle">Periods or menstruation is normal vaginal bleeding that occurs as part of a woman's monthly cycle. Once a month, a woman's body prepares for pregnancy, and if no pregnancy occurs then the uterus, also known as the womb, sheds its lining. The menstrual blood is partly tissue and partly blood from inside the uterus, and it flows out of the body through the vagina. Periods last around 2-7 days, and the average age that girls start their period is 12 years.</p> 
    <br>
    <p class="middle">The menstrual cycle is the time from the first day of a woman's period, to the day before their next period. The length of the menstrual cycle varies from woman to woman, but the average length of the menstrual cycle is 28 days. </p>

    <h1>What is Period Poverty?</h1>
    <br>
  <div class="topic">
        <img class= "whatp" src="https://sites.utexas.edu/thechattygal/files/2021/01/IMG_0192-900x400.jpg">
    <p class="periodpov">Period Poverty is the lack of access to menstrual products and menstrual health education, because of financial constraints and the stigma behind periods. Period poverty affects many women across the United States as well as the world. Period products in most states in the U.S. are taxed as a luxury product, when in reality it is natural.</p>
    <br>
  <h2>Health issues caused by period poverty</h2>
    <p>Period poverty can lead to the many health issues. Without access to menstrual products, women may use unsanitary period products, like dirty rags, instead during their period. This can cause infections and other medical problems. To add on, women may skip meals or take medication in order to draw out their period, and this can lead to anemia and create eating disorders. Additionaly, period poverty can also negatively affect the mental health of women.</p>
    <br>
  <h2>How education is affected</h2>
    <p>Women who cannot afford period products may not attend school, because they do not want to risk bleeding through their clothes. They may also fear being teased, because of the negative stigma about periods. </p>
    <br>
    <h2>How physical activity is affected</h2>
    <p>Women who can not afford menstrual products may be embarresssed to participate in sports, because they may not want to get changed or they may be worried about leaking. This is a problem, because excersize is essential for keeping our lungs and heart healthy. Excersizing also reduces stress levels and can release endorphins. Therefore, women who miss out on sports/excersizing because of period poverty may be at risk for poor health in the future.</p>
